# RiverCelerityModeling
This is a project I did for my Data Mining class. In this course we were attempting to model the celerity of rivers. Celerity is the speed at which water travels down a river bed. This would allow us to see how long it would take for flash floods or other important river events to travel down stream.

The data collection for this project had to be done manually and can be seen in the Data Collection notebook. We used river sensor data provided by ugss to perform the data extraction. All analysis on this data is located in the Analysis*.ipynb files. Various forms of linear regressions and data transformations were performed. We analysised two different river systems the Freemont to Dirty Devil and San Rafeal upper to San Rafeal lower.

After analysis of the data we found that Ridge Regression on Logrithmically transformed data performed the best for both river systems. A project poster for this data analysis project can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/ssmele/RiverCelerityModeling/blob/master/project_poster.pdf)
